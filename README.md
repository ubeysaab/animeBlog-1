the new version of  anime blog with rest api and with backEnd and frontEnd Connected

it's a blog use to publish new about animes and their story and release times
---
AnimeNewsBlog with MERN stack
which is 

**MongoDb** :MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need

**Express**: is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications

**React** : Component-Based. Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,

**Node** : the premier JavaScript web server




> i used MERN  stack because is good  combination of js technologies.
 I preferred to use these technologies because my project should contain components going to update independently and without affecting other components and react  which the best practice for this




## SetUP
first when you download this Code you just have nodeJs downloaded first then  run 
`npm init `
npm init : 
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields  
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and       
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

for download dependency for each of backEnd and frontEnd 
you may be need to download  mongodb and express and nodemon if already don't have them on your system you can install them inside backEnd folder in your project if you use npm `npm install express mongoose` or if you use yarn `yarn add express mongoose`

We also need some dev dependencies to securely use private keys in our dev env i.e. dotenv and nodemon to restart our server on hitting save.
with npm `npm install nodemon dotenv --save-dev` ,with yarn :`yarn add nodemon dotenv -D`
